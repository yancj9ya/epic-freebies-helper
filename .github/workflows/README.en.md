# GitHub Actions Guide

Language versions:

- [简体中文](README.md)
- English (this page)

The repository already includes [`.github/workflows/epic-gamer.yml`](epic-gamer.yml). Using it directly is the recommended way to run scheduled claims.

## What the Workflow Does

The workflow runs the following steps on a GitHub-hosted runner:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Install `uv` and Python 3.12.
3. Install system dependencies.
4. Run `uv sync` to install Python dependencies.
5. Download Camoufox browser assets.
6. Install Playwright Firefox as a browser fallback.
7. Run `uv run app/deploy.py` inside `xvfb`.

The workflow is triggered by GitHub `schedule` and `workflow_dispatch`. APScheduler inside the repository is disabled in this mode to avoid duplicate scheduling.

## Required Secrets

Required in all cases:

| Secret | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EPIC_EMAIL` | Epic account email, with 2FA disabled |
| `EPIC_PASSWORD` | Epic account password, with 2FA disabled |

If you use Gemini / AiHubMix:

| Secret | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | Recommended value: `gemini` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini or AiHubMix key |
| `GEMINI_BASE_URL` | Optional, defaults to `https://aihubmix.com` |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Optional, defaults to `gemini-2.5-pro` |

If you use GLM:

| Secret | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | Recommended value: `glm` |
| `GLM_API_KEY` | Zhipu API key |
| `GLM_BASE_URL` | Optional, defaults to `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` |
| `GLM_MODEL` | Optional, recommended: `glm-4.6v` |

The `GLM` path does not require a separate `GEMINI_API_KEY`. The project now bridges that lower-level compatibility requirement automatically.

The program also checks these per-task overrides first. If they are not set, they fall back automatically to `GLM_MODEL` or `GEMINI_MODEL`:

- `CHALLENGE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`
- `IMAGE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`
- `SPATIAL_POINT_REASONER_MODEL`
- `SPATIAL_PATH_REASONER_MODEL`

These values can also be configured directly as GitHub Secrets. The workflow already passes them through.

## Local One-Shot Debugging

To reproduce the same entrypoint locally, use the same runtime path as the workflow:

1. Copy [`.env.example`](../../.env.example) to `.env`
2. Fill in your own account and model configuration
3. Run `uv sync --group dev`
4. Run `ENABLE_APSCHEDULER=false uv run app/deploy.py`

`.env`, `.venv`, and `app/volumes/` are already ignored by `.gitignore`, so local sensitive/runtime files stay out of commits.

## Why GLM Cannot Simply Reuse the Gemini Base URL

The lower-level dependency is `hcaptcha-challenger`, and internally it uses `google-genai`-style multimodal upload plus `generate_content`.

This repository now includes an adapter layer:

- Gemini / AiHubMix continues to use the existing compatibility patch.
- GLM is translated automatically into Zhipu's OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` requests.

That is why GLM here should use a vision-capable model such as `glm-4.6v`, not a plain text coding model.
If `glm-4.6v-flash` starts returning overload messages such as "the current model is too busy", switching to `GLM_MODEL=glm-4.6v` is usually more stable.

## Recommended First Run

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fork private.
3. Configure Secrets.
4. Trigger one manual run from the `Actions` page.
5. Inspect the logs to confirm that login and claiming both completed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not cancel the workflow just because it is still retrying after around 5 minutes. Login captcha and checkout verification can fail repeatedly, retry many times, and even hit timeouts before finally passing. Some successful runs still take 15 to 20 minutes.

If `Camoufox` fails to download or bootstrap on a specific runner, the workflow now continues with an installed Playwright Firefox fallback instead of failing immediately during browser setup.

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

To avoid running outdated code in your fork, sync regularly with the upstream repository (`Ronchy2000/epic-freebies-helper`), especially before retrying after an unexpected failure.

On the GitHub web UI, open your fork's default branch, click `Sync fork` -> `Update branch`, and rerun the workflow afterward. If GitHub reports a conflict, click `Compare changes`, follow the prompt to create and merge the pull request, and then return to `Actions` to run the workflow again.

## FAQ

### 1. The Action ran but login got stuck

Epic may rate-limit or risk-control GitHub's shared outbound IPs. In many cases, rerunning at a different time resolves it.

If the logs are still retrying captcha challenges, do not click `Cancel workflow` too early. A run that ends in a manual cancel like the example below does not prove the automation had already failed after only a few minutes:

![Do not cancel the Actions run too early](../../docs/images/faq/action-cancel-too-early.svg)

The workflow now attempts to upload an extra `epic-screenshots-<run_id>` artifact. This artifact only appears at the bottom of the run page when the login, risk-control, or auth flow actually saved screenshots. If the logs only show messages like `Timeout waiting for #email`, `Just a moment...`, or `One more step`, and the Artifacts section contains a screenshot package, inspect that artifact first.

### 2. Logs mention `privacy-policy correction`

This is usually not a `GLM`, `Gemini`, or `AiHubMix` API issue. It means the Epic account was redirected after login to a page like `/id/login/correction/privacy-policy`.

Fix it by signing in to Epic once in a normal browser, completing the privacy-policy confirmation page manually, and then rerunning the workflow.

### 3. GLM returns 429 / 400 / 401

Check these items first:

- If logs contain `message=该模型当前访问量过大，请您稍后再试` or HTTP `429`, switch `GLM_MODEL` to `glm-4.6v` first and avoid `glm-4.6v-flash`.
- Confirm `LLM_PROVIDER=glm`.
- Confirm `GLM_BASE_URL=https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`.
- Confirm `GLM_MODEL=glm-4.6v`.
- Confirm the API key is still valid.

Example log for a 429 rate-limit case:

![GLM 429 rate limit log](../../docs/images/faq/glm-429-rate-limit.png)

### 4. Why run daily instead of weekly?

Running once per day is safer on GitHub Actions. The script itself decides whether there is any new weekly free content and exits quickly when there is nothing to claim.
